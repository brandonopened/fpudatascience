Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Alexandra Moreno- Github seems overly complicated at first but I can see how it can be beneficial when coders are collaborating. It definitely is nice seeing changes instantly to code. 
Hi, I would like to agree with Alexandra!!
