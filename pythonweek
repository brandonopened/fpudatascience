Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Alexandra Moreno- Github seems overly complicated at first but I can see how it can be beneficial when coders are collaborating. It definitely is nice seeing changes instantly to code. 
Erick, I like it, but I need more hours to learn it. I would use it to collaborate with other colleagues to write/modify simple codes. Honestly, I would like to know how to use it so that I could teach my students.
